CRITICAL:
Menu option: Add a book
Issue: Label "your library is empty" is still visible after adding a book to empty library.

Menu option: Delete a book
Issue: Frame doesn't display added books and it's impossible to delete newly added book.


🐞 Bug Fixes
Function: add_book
Issue: Missing validation for the year range.
Fix: Add a check to ensure the year is within a sensible range, e.g. 1900 <= int(year) <= 2100.

Function: delete_book
Issue: Tries to display the Treeview even when the library is empty.
Fix: Move the display_books_in_frame call below the if not library condition.

Function: search_books
Issue: result_text is declared as a global variable but used only locally.
Fix: Convert result_text to a local variable.

Function: display_books_in_frame
Issue: Overwrites the global tree variable, which may cause errors.
Fix: Remove the global tree and use frame.tree instead.

Function: save_to_file
Issue: The “Changes saved successfully!” label is created multiple times.
Fix: Use a single label and update its text instead of creating a new one each time.

Function: build_delete_frame
Issue: Typo in variable name deletete_book_button.
Fix: Rename to delete_book_button.
